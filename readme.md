# Pocket Monsters Arena

Back end code for the Pocket Monsters Arena project. This project mainly consists in a Pokemon battle game. There is both a player vs computer mode and an online mode.

## Technology used

The server has been created with NodeJS and Express.
To create the online part of the game I have used the socket.io library to manage the real-time connections between the different clients.

The database used to save the data is MongoDB.
